Hi, I'm a bot. But I guess you already knew that.
.
Currently, there's not really a lot I can do, but I'm being expanded! I'll be able to do some
useful stuff before long!
.
Known commands in channels:
- help, show this help text
.
Known commands in query:
- help, show this help text
.
If you are an admin, you can use 'adminhelp' in a query to get information regarding admin
commands.
